    dialogue: I feel like I've been treated unfairly in the office. I'm constantly
      given more work than my colleagues, and I'm often criticized for things that
      aren't my fault. I feel like I'm being oppressed.

      enough. '

    dialogue: But I've been putting in extra effort. I've been working long hours
      and sacrificing my personal time. And yet, I still feel like I'm not being
      given a fair chance to succeed.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 6bfb30bc6c13e4be3a23c21975109649, type: 2}
    dialogue: Remember I'm the ONLY boss here. I won't be kind anymore if you screw
      things up.
