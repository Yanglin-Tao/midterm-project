    dialogue: Hello, Mr. Bill Man. I'm here to talk to you about the rent. I'm having
      a bit of trouble making ends meet this month, and I was wondering if we could
      work out a payment plan?
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b7e18b018ff064cda916fd90bcd5eb1e, type: 2}
    dialogue: Oh, so now you're having trouble paying the bill? That's just great.
      You know, I'm sick and tired of your excuses. You're always late with the rent
      and you're always causing problems.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 15253d1f520db44c28cf0a1540e959bb, type: 2}
    dialogue: I know, and I'm sorry. I'm doing everything I can to make ends meet.
      I have a family to feed and it's not easy these days.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b7e18b018ff064cda916fd90bcd5eb1e, type: 2}
    dialogue: Well, that's not my problem. You signed a lease and you agreed to pay
      the rent on time. I don't have to cut you any slack.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 15253d1f520db44c28cf0a1540e959bb, type: 2}
    dialogue: I understand that, but I'm not asking for anything unreasonable. I
      just need a little more time to come up with the money.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b7e18b018ff064cda916fd90bcd5eb1e, type: 2}
    dialogue: No way I can't do that. If you don't pay the bill by the end of the
      month, I'll have to take everything from you.
